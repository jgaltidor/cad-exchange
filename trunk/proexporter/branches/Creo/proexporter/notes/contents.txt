Description of files in the package
===================================

notes.txt - Contains import notes and documents
            important steps during development
            of this project.


Source Files
------------
*.cpp - Implementation Files
*.h   - Header Files

protk.dat/no_protk.dat
- Whenever Pro/E is launched, it searches for a
  protk.dat file in the current working directory.
  protk.dat files are configuration files specifying
  how to load and run a ProToolkit application.
  The protk.dat in this directory tells Pro/E to
  load and run proexporter.dll.
  When I do not want Pro/E to load proexporter.dll,
  I will rename protk.dat to no_protk.dat.


Build scripts
-------------
IMPORTANT NOTE
- To build binaries, execute Makefile
  from a Visual Studio Command Prompt.

Makefile Targets
----------------
proexporter.exe - Builds proexporter.exe
dll - Builds proexporter.dll
clean - Remove intermediate files generated for building
        the '.exe' and '.dll' files; for example,
				removes '.exp' and '.ilk' files.
distclean - Runs clean target and removes
            '.exe' and '.dll' files.

Run scripts
------------
proexporter.bat - Runs proexporter.exe on the file arguments passed
testasync1.bat - Runs proexporter.exe on example_draft.prt.1

testsync1.bat
 - Calls proe.exe to load proexporter.dll and generate
   XML of features in unittests\example_draft.prt.1
 - protk.dat must exists in the working directory
testsync2.bat
 - Calls proe.exe to load proexporter.dll and generate
   XML of features in unittests\base.prt.1
 - protk.dat must exists in the working directory

Clean script
---------------------------------------
clean_proe.bat
 - Removes files generated by Pro/E (not proexporter);
   e.g. removes trail.txt.*
